# ðŸŽ¯ Insights :
ðŸ“Š Attrition Breakdown Insights
1. By Age
Highest attrition in 26â€“35 age group (116 people)

ðŸ”Ž This group is usually mid-career professionals. High attrition may suggest job dissatisfaction, better offers, or lack of growth opportunities.

2. By Gender
Male: 150, Female: 87

ðŸ”Ž Slight male-dominant attrition, but gender distribution in overall population would clarify further.

3. By Education
Life Sciences (38%), Medical (27%) are top contributors

ðŸ”Ž Either these degrees are over-represented or roles requiring them have poor retention.

4. By Salary
Major attrition from salaries below 5K (163 people)

ðŸ”Ž Strong correlation between low pay and attrition â€” likely compensation-related exits.

5. By Job Role : 
Top roles by attrition:

Laboratory Technician: 62

Sales Executive: 57

Research Scientist: 47

Sales Representative: 33

ðŸ”Ž These roles might be overburdened, underpaid, or have limited growth. Sales-related roles consistently have high exits.

6. Attrition Over Tenure (Years at Company)
Peak attrition happens around 1â€“2 years, then drops.

ðŸ”Ž Early turnover is a big concern â€” onboarding, expectations, or mismatch could be at fault.

# ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Recommendations :
ðŸ“ˆFocus retention efforts on 26â€“35 age group â€” consider mentorship, career planning, and pay bumps.

ðŸ“ˆRevisit compensation for employees under 5K â€” they form the bulk of attrition.

ðŸ“ˆInvestigate high-churn job roles â€” run exit interviews and workload evaluations for lab and sales teams.

ðŸ“ˆEnhance onboarding and engagement in first 2 years â€” possibly set up buddy systems or fast-track growth plans.

ðŸ“ˆReview educational backgrounds with high attrition â€” check if skill mismatches or overqualification are factors.
